# Getting started
scglue implements the GLUE (Graph Linked Unified Embedding) model, for unpaired single-cell multi-omics data integration.

`SVC` (Spatially embedded Virtual Cell) is a ViT-based Spatial Virtual Cell model for deciphering subcellular spatial transcriptomic heterogeneity. 

SVC characterizes and predicts subcellular gene expression patterns within their native tissue context, enabling analyses across subcellular, cellular, and tissue scales.

SVC offers a new lens for interpreting subcellular ST data and yields a range of biological insights that are difficult to capture with approaches limited to single-cell resolution or specific analytic tasks.
